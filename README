A PAM module, based on pam_exec, to execute external binaries or scripts in a
safe environment. This module provides the ability to pipe stdout and stderr
to a logfile; set the UID and GID of the process to the target user; set the
UID of the process to the EUID it is running as.

The external process will have the following environment variables, along with
the standard ones provided by the PAM stack:
 * PAM_USER    - target user
 * PAM_SERVICE - service running the PAM stack
 * PAM_TTY     - TTY in use
 * PAM_RHOST   - remote host calling the PAM stack
 * PAM_RUSER   - remote user
 * PAM_TYPE    - 'auth', 'account', 'password', 'open_session' or
                 'close_session' depending on the PAM invocation

Usage:
 pam_exec2.so [options] /path/to/executable [args]

Options:
 * debug     - send debug information to syslog
 * quiet     - no output to application
 * drop_priv - set UID and GID to target user (PAM_USER)
 * seteuid   - set UID to EUID of calling process
 * syslog    - redirect stdout and stderr to syslog, as LOG_AUTHPRIV|LOG_ERR
 * once      - use pam-once to limit execution to first open_session and last
               close_session of a user - only applicable for session type
 * type=...  - only execute if PAM_TYPE matches ...
 * log=...   - redirect stdout and stderr to ...

drop_priv and seteuid are mutually exclusive, as are syslog and log=...
